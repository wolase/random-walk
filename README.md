# Random Walk Simulation in 2D and 3D

This Python project simulates random walks in both 2D and 3D spaces. The random walks are visualized with static plots and animated GIFs, which are automatically saved in an `output` folder located at the same level as the main script.

## Features

- **2D Random Walk**
  - Moves in 8 directions: north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest.
  - Generates a static plot showing the path of the walk.
  - Creates an animated GIF visualizing the walk step by step.

- **3D Random Walk**
  - Moves in 18 directions including vertical movements (up and down).
  - Generates a 3D static plot.
  - Creates a 3D animated GIF.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the main script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
